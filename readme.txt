########## Execution ##########

1. Download GTZAN database from http://marsyasweb.appspot.com/download/data_sets/
2. Unpack it in the "data" folder in a way such that the code can access the "data" folder like ./../data
3. Run convert.py to create genres_wav folder inside data
4. De-comment the last line of process.py to extract data into csv files
5. Comment out the last line of process.py again
6. Run main.py
7. Run test.py

########## plots ##########

Plots generated by pca.py are stored here.

########## models ##########

Models computed by our code is stored here. model2 stores last model computed for 2-layer ANN and 
model3 stores last model computed for 3-layer ANN.

########## results.txt ##########

Results of function "net" are stored here after running main.py. Each run of main.py adds a new line to it upon 
successful training. The columns tabulate from left to right:

genres used in the computation of model, epochs, learning_rate, 
accuracy on training data, accuracy on test data, [nodes used in hidden layers], number of hidden layers used

Genres used is a numeric sequence containing positions of the genres in the list ['blues', 'classical', 'country', 'disco', 'hiphop', 'jazz', 'metal', 'pop', 'reggae', 'rock']. So 37 => ['disco', 'pop']. These numeric sequences 
are written in ascending order i.e. 37 instead of 73 to make search easier for an experiment with the genres 
['disco', 'pop'] in this case.

########## other files ##########
Other files are used during computation of a model by main.py, to learn what they contain checkout docstring for the
function "store" implemented in process.py
